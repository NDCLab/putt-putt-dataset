# putt-putt dataset

## Project Goal
This dataset seeks to test whether error-related brain activity differs between socially anxious and non-anxious participants within an ecologically valid task context. Towards this end, we will assess error-related brain activity during a real-world golf task. 

By employing a sports task for the ecologically valid task, the study also has potential implications for understanding choking under pressure in the context of sports.


## Background & Design
Prior research has shown that socially anxious individuals show more error-related brain activity under social observation (Buzzell et al., 2020). However, the majority of prior work has focused on highly constrained lab tasks that bear little resemblance to real-world situations. There is little work investigating the effect of social context on relations between social anxiety and more ecologically valid measures of cognitive control (e.g., cognitive control during sport performance). The current study aims to not only close these gaps in a broader investigation of how particular cognitive abilities, and personality or social factors, relate to mental health outcomes.

Participants will complete a set of questionnaires assessing social anxiety followed by a flanker task (assessing inhibitory control abilities) along with a golf putting task. Each task will be completed twice; once while alone (creating a “nonsocial context”) and once while being observed by the experimenter (creating a “social context”). We use EEG to assess error detection.
