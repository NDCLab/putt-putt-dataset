# Golf task for putt-putt-dataset

### Instructions
This folder contains the stimuli used to sync the clocks between the EEG recording and the video recording. 


### Project Notes

The study room is set up with a camera recording the participant, the putting green, and a stimulus computer located behind the participant during the task. The stimulus computer is synced to the EEG computer located outside the study room and shows a marker every 6 seconds, which is used to sync the clocks between the EEG recording and the video recording. The video recordings are coded in Datavyu to mark time stamps for the onset of a participant making contact with the golf ball, and then whether an error was detected (i.e., whether the ball went in the hole or not).
